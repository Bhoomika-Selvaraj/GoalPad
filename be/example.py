ðŸ”¹ Goal: I want to learn [SUBJECT/GOAL] in 6 months (24 weeks).
Guidelines:
Split the 6 months into 24 weeks.
For each week, provide a list of actionable to-dos only (not grouped by "read/watch/practice").
Each todo must begin with its Eisenhower quadrant in braces, e.g.
{Q1} Learn FastAPI basics
{Q2} Revise networking fundamentals
{Q3} Check optional forum posts
{Q4} Avoid random YouTube distractions
Use quadrants fairly and beautifully distribute tasks (donâ€™t dump everything into Q1).
Q1 = Urgent + Important â†’ Do First
Q2 = Not Urgent + Important â†’ Schedule
Q3 = Urgent + Not Important â†’ Delegate/Minimize
Q4 = Not Urgent + Not Important â†’ Eliminate/Avoid
Assume ~3 hours/day of effort, and Sundays are rest days.
At the end of each week, add a Weekly Review Task (quiz, reflection, or mini-project), also tagged with its quadrant.
By Week 24, I should demonstrate competence through a capstone project (tagged Q1).
Output format:
Week X â€“ [Theme]
{Q1} Todo 1
{Q2} Todo 2
{Q3} Todo 3
{Q4} Todo 4
Weekly Review Task: {Q1} [review/quiz/project]
Now, please generate the full 24-week plan in this format for [SUBJECT/GOAL].
